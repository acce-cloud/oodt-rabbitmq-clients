# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
# Adapted from: http://pika.readthedocs.io/en/0.10.0/examples/asynchronous_publisher_example.html
#
# Features:
# o Requests delivery confirmation from RabbitMQ server
#   and keeps tracks of which messages have been acknowledged or not acknowledged
# o Reconnects if connection to RabbitMQ servers goes down for any reason
# o Shuts down if RabbitMQ server closes the channel
#
# Connection parameters are specified through the environmental variables:
# o RABBITMQ_USER_URL (to send messages)
# o RABBITMQ_ADMIN_URL (to monitor message delivery)
#
# Usage: python rabbitmq_producer.py <workflow_event> <number_of_events> [<metadata_key=metadata_value> <metadata_key=metadata_value> ...]
# To be used together with rabbitmq_consumer.py
